# country:us division types

* state         - Any of the 50 states.
* state/county  - A county (defined in most states as the primary division beneath state)
* state/cd      - Federal Congressional Districts [note: 0 is used to indicate at large]
* state/place   - A place (using the census definition) covers cities, towns, villages, etc.
                  **Because cross-county places are common, and there are a number of independent cities, it was decided to move place to be a peer of county.**
