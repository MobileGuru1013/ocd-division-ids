Precinct mappings map a comprehensive list of precincts in a state to some identifier (usually a number). There are three general categories of mappings:

1. **State identifiers**: the state keeps a list of identifiers, often published alongside election results. Mappings of this type (links to results where possible): [AK](http://www.elections.alaska.gov/ei_return_2012_GENR.php), DC, [DE](http://elections.delaware.gov/results/html/stwres.shtml), [HI](http://hawaii.gov/elections/results/2012/general/files/media.txt), [MN](http://www.sos.state.mn.us/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=12177), RI, VA

2. **County identifiers**: the counties keep a list of identifiers, which the state often publishes alongside election results. Mappings of this type (links to results where possible): [AZ](http://www.azsos.gov/results/2012/general/), [KY](http://elect.ky.gov/SiteCollectionDocuments/Election%20Results/2010-2019/2012/statprctg.txt), [MT](http://electionresults.sos.mt.gov/CanvassExports.aspx), [SC](http://www.scvotes.org/data/scsec/RP0120_PollingLocations.csv), WA

3. **Placeholder identifiers**: we create fabricated identifiers only as a way to publish a comprehensive list of precinct identifiers per state while maintaining the format of (1) and (2). These fabricated identifiers should never be used; they are placeholders. Mappings of this type: CT, GA, KS, MA, NH, VT
